DESCRIPTION
    Attache.pm is an OO interface to the ClearCase CLI facility on Win32
    systems (attcmd). You need attcmd installed to be able to use this
    module.

  METHODS

    new($ws,[$attcmd])
        Constructs a new attache command: takes the workspace as a mandatory
        argument. Optional argument is the path to attcmd.

    getWs()
        returns the curent workspace

    setWs($ws)
        sets the current workspace

    vault()
        Returns the local physical location for the current workspace, e.g:

            my $a=Attache->new("alfo_dev7");
            print $a->vault(),"\n";
            # prints F:\home\alf\ClearCase\alfo_dev7 on my machine
    
    lastoutput()
        returns the output of the last issued command, as an array of lines
        (trailing newlines and CR removed)

    hasErrors()
        true if the last command had erros

    errors()
        returns the error diagnostics of the last issued command, as an
        array of lines (trailing newlines and CR removed)

    hasWarnings()
        true if the last command had warnings

    warnings()
        returns the warning diagnostics of the last issued command, as an
        array of lines (trailing newlines and CR removed)

    [any_attcmd_command]($argstring)
        executes any given attache command, with the given args, for
        instance:

            my $a=Attache->new("alfo_dev7");
            $a->co(' -c "None of your business" /tt_vob/foo/bar/baz.cpp'); 

        Arguments are processed by the shell, so caution with quoting,
        special characters etc. should be exercised. DO NOT include any
        workspace indication - it is automatically inserted.

        Please consult the attache documentation to find out which commands
        are supported.

    setlog($path,[$appendflag])
        Calling setlog directs attache to direct the comand output ti the
        given file. If the (optional) $appendflag is true, the file is
        opened in append mode and any previous content is preserved, rather
        than truncated (the default). Calling

            $a->setlog(undef)

        Disables logging.

  EXPORT

    None

  INSTALLATION

    Just drop in any directory of your INCLUDE path, or read the FindBin
    docs and do something along the lines of:

      use FindBin qw($Bin);
      use lib ($Bin,"$Bin/../perl/lib", "$Bin/../lib/perl","$Bin/../lib");
      #
      use Attache;

  SUPPORTED VERSIONS AND PLATFORMS

    Tested with perl 5.6 (ActiveState build 623) on Windows NT. For Unix,
    check the Clearcase wrapper on the nearest CPAN site
    (http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Clearcase).

    Lesser perl versions may work (I'm almost positive about 5.5). Windowze
    (non-NT) may also work, but I doubt it, as command.com is even more
    broken than cmd.exe .

  BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    No effort is made to ensure workspace validity. Setlog should accept
    filehandle objects, and it should be possible to log directly to STDOUT
    or STDERR.

    Due to the cretin way in which cmd.exe handles command line quoting,
    some combinations of (legitimate) arguments may break Attache - when
    this happens, please direct your grievances to:

        Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, U.S.A.

    Every command starts a new attcmd.exe. If anybody knows a way to use
    attcmd over a pipe (or a COM interface, or something else) pls. let me
    know.
